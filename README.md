# PasswordGenerator
This is a Python algorithm for creating computer-generated passwords. 
The password will include numbers, lowercase letters, uppercase letters and symbols.
The password will have 4 sequences, seperated by an underscore (_). All 4 sequnces will be different than each other.
The sequences will be 6 characters long, and will have at least one character from the groups. 4 characters will be randomly chosen and combined with 2 other characters
that will also be randomly selected from the groups.
This algorithm takes inspiration from Apple's password generator, but it is more secure and has more independence regarding the choice of characters that are to be used.
